# react-projects
will be only react projects.

here I will leave the links for each project, and if you want to check the code, just choose the project file by numeration.


#links

1-st project : https://delicate-khapse-3e59cd.netlify.app/

2-nd project : https://6686ddcac0f6554f320e730f--lighthearted-banoffee-e77852.netlify.app/

3-rd project : couldn't host, cuz of some errors while hosting on gh-pages, so I leaved it as a Sort of "did project". It is also mobile adapted, and I consider it as a harder than other first two projects, but if you want to check it locally, then checkout the Readme.md which i provided in 3rd-project folder.
