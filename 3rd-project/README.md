So, ofc you need to download node.js and npm, but I will start building it locally. 

first of all, download the folder and find it through your local terminal. Then find your downloaded folder. For example, I've saved it in desktop, so I need to find it like this : 
cd desktop
cd 3rd-project

after I find it, I need to install modules of npm. type (npm install) in your local terminal.

after loading packages, run npm run dev and here you are. Btw, don't forget to set up Vite bundle, otherwise I don't think it will work.

Btw, if some images are not loading, it is ok. cuz I didn't upload some files and cuz of 25MB restriction. So, My rep is not working by using "git init". if you want to check it perfectly, the please consider to dm me in telegram : @rekew
